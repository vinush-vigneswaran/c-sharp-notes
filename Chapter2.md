<a name="02.1"></a>
### 2.1 - Printing "Hello, C\#"  
1. Create a **new project** using a **Console Application**
2. Name your project (e.g. "HelloCS") and choose a location. Solutions allow you to create and manage multiple projects - for "Solution name" you can put Chapter01 (or Project01)
3. Pick framework .NET 5.0 (we will use the older version for now). If it is not available in the drop down menu follow the instructions below:

 	> Visual Studio Installer (through Windows start menu) > MS Visual Studio 2022 > Modify > Individual Components > Tick .NET 5.0 Runtime > Restart Visual Studio and go to step 1.

 4. Modify the relevant line to print "Hello, C#!"
 5. Run the code by going to "Debug" > "Start without Debugging"
